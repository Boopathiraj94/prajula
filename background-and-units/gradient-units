Gradient-colors
CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
CSS defines three types of gradients:
•	Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
•	Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
•	Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);
Direction - Top to Bottom (this is default)
background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red , yellow);
Direction - Diagonal
You can make a gradient diagonally by specifying both the horizontal and vertical starting positions.
Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color-stop1, color-stop2);
background-image: linear-gradient(red 10%, yellow, green);
 background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red,orange,yellow,green,blue,indigo,violet);
background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 20%);

CSS Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center.
To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.
Syntax
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);
background-image: radial-gradient(closest-side at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black); x –axis y- axis
background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-side at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black);
background-image: radial-gradient(closest-corner at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black);
background-image: radial-gradient(farthest-corner at 60% 55%, red, yellow, black);
background-image: repeating-radial-gradient(red, yellow 10%, green 15%);
CSS Conic Gradients
A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.
To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.
Syntax
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
By default, angle is 0deg and position is center.
If no degree is specified, the colors will be spread equally around the center point.
 background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green);
 background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, black);
background-image: conic-gradient(red 45deg, yellow 90deg, green 210deg);
background-image: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, black);
  border-radius: 50%;

 background-image: conic-gradient(red 0deg, red 90deg, yellow 90deg, yellow 180deg, green 180deg, green 270deg, blue 270deg);
  border-radius: 50%;
background-image: conic-gradient(from 90deg, red, yellow, green);

background-image: conic-gradient(at 60% 45%, red, yellow, green);
background-image: repeating-conic-gradient(red 10%, yellow 20%);
  border-radius: 50%;

The background-blend-mode Property defines how the element's background image should blend with each other and with the element's background-color. 

background-blend-mode: normal|multiply|screen|darken|lighten|
color-dodge|saturation|difference|luminosity|overlay;



CSS Units (Sizing concepts)
CSS has several different units for expressing a length.
CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.
Absolute Units
The absolute length units are fixed
1.	Cm – centimetres, 
2.	mm - millimetres, 
3.	in -  inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm) 
4.	px * pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in) 
5.	pt points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
6.	pc picas (1pc = 12 pt) 
Relative Units
7.	Em - 		Relative to the Parent Element
8.	Rem - 		Relative to the root element r=> root element
9.	Vw	- 	Relative to the width of the viewport*
10.	Vh - 		Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*
11.	Vmin - 	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension
12.	Vmax - 	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension
13.	% - 		Relative to the parent element
